Package time-averaging assembles functions for analyzing age distribution of individually dated fossil specimens. The package is designed for datasets that include posteriorly calibrated ages (typically calibrated radiocarbon or amino-acid racemization dates). Example datasets are included.

The current version of the package time-averaging can be downloaded from Github.

```{r installing timeavraging package, eval = FALSE}
install.packages('devtools')
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github('mjkowalewski/timeaveraging', build_vignettes = TRUE)
library(PaleoFidelity)
```

The following functions and datasets are included:

*agemoments* - a function that provides basic descriptors of age distributions and can be used with other functions

*bahamas* - a list with two dataframes

$spec - specimen level data

$post - posterior probability distributions for each specimen (30 echinoid specimens and 30 mollusk specimens).
